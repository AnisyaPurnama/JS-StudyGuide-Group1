            In the JavaScript data types tutorial, you learned about 7 different primitive data types. And here, you are going to learn about the eighth data-type(JavaScript object). JavaScript object is a non-primitive data-type that allows you to store multiple
            collections of data.
        </p>
        <blockquote><span class='mark'>Note:</span> If you are familiar with other programming languages, JavaScript objects are a bit different. You do not need to create classes in order to create objects.
        </blockquote>
        <ul>Here is an example of a JavaScript object.
            <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/01/01.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
            <li>Here, <code>student</code> is an object that stores values such as strings and numbers.</li>

            <h4>JavaScript Declare Objects</h4>
            The syntax to declare an object is:
            <ul>
<!--Every code you want to present, you will copy it from the site and paste it in js file with anumber and just change the number here-->
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/01/02.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
                <li>Here, an object <code>object_name</code> is defined. Each member of an object is a <span class='mark'>key: value</span> pair separated by commas and enclosed in curly braces <code>{}</code></li>
                <li>For example,</li>
                <pre class='line-numbers ' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/01/03.js ' eval js-tutor></pre>
                <li>You can also define an object in a single line.</li>
                <pre class='line-numbers ' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/01/04.js ' eval js-tutor></pre>
                <li>In the above example, <code>name</code> and <code>age</code> are keys, and <code>John</code> and <code>20</code> are values respectively. There are other ways to declare an object in JavaScript. To learn more, visit Different
                    ways to declare JavaScript objects.

    <h4>JavaScript Object Properties</h4>
    In JavaScript, "key: value" pairs are called properties. For example,
    <ul>
        <!--Every code you want to present, you will copy it from the site and paste it in js file with anumber and just change the number here-->
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/01/05.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        <li>Here, <code>name : 'John'</code> and <code>age : 20</code> are properties.</li>

    <h4>Accessing Object Properties</h4>
    You can access the value of a property by using its key.
    ​
    <ul>
    <!--Every code you want to present, you will copy it from the site and paste it in js file with anumber and just change the number here-->
        ​<h5>1. Using dot Notation</h5>
        For example,
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/01/06.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        <h5>2. Using bracket Notation</h5>
        Here is the syntax of the bracket notation.
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/01/07.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        For example,
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/01/08.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
    </ul>

    <h4>JavaScript Nested Objects</h4>
    An object can also contain another object. For example,​
    <ul>
    <!--Every code you want to present, you will copy it from the site and paste it in js file with anumber and just change the number here-->
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/01/09.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        In the above example, an object student contains an object value in the marks property.
    </ul>

    <h4>JavaScript Object Methods</h4>
    In JavaScript, an object can also contain a function. For example,​
    <ul>
    <!--Every code you want to present, you will copy it from the site and paste it in js file with anumber and just change the number here-->
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/01/10.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        Here, a function is used as a value for the greet key. That's why we need to use <code>person.greet()</code> instead of <code>person.greet</code> to call the function inside the object.

        A JavaScript method is a property containing a function declaration. In the next tutorial, you will learn about JavaScript Methods in detail.

                <li>In the above example, a <code>person</code> object has a key( <code>name</code> and <code>greet</code> ) and string value and a function value.

                    Hence basically, the JavaScript method is an object property that has a function value.</li>

    <h4>Accessing Object Methods</h4>
    You can access a method by calling an objectName and a key for that method along with <code>()</code>. And you can access property only by calling an objectName and a key. For example,
    <ul>
    <!--Every code you want to present, you will copy it from the site and paste it in js file with anumber and just change the number here-->
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/02/02.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        Here, the <code>greet</code> method is accessed as <code>person.greet()</code> instead of <code>person.greet</code>.

        If you try to access the method with only <code>person.greet</code>, it will give you a function definition.
    </ul>

    <h4>JavaScript Built-In Methods</h4>
    In JavaScript, there are many built-in methods. For example,
    <ul>
    <!--Every code you want to present, you will copy it from the site and paste it in js file with anumber and just change the number here-->
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/02/03.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        Here, the <code>parseInt()</code> method of Number object is used to convert numeric string value to an integer value.
    </ul>

    <h4>Adding a Method to a JavaScript Object</h4>
    You can also add a method in an object. For example,
    <ul>
    <!--Every code you want to present, you will copy it from the site and paste it in js file with anumber and just change the number here-->
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/02/04.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        In the above example, an empty <code>student</code> object is created. Then, the <code>name</code> property is added. Similarly, the <code>greet</code> method is also added. In this way, you can add a method as well as property to an object.
    </ul>

    <h4>JavaScript this Keyword</h4>
    To access a property of an object from within a method of the same object, you need to use the <code>this</code> keyword. Let's consider an example.
    <ul>
    <!--Every code you want to present, you will copy it from the site and paste it in js file with anumber and just change the number here-->
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/02/05.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        In the above example, a <code>person</code> object is created. It contains properties(<code>name</code> and <code>age</code>) and a method greet.

        In the method <code>greet</code>, while accessing a property of an object, <code>this</code> keyword is used.

        In order to access the properties of an object, <code>this</code> keyword is used following with <code>.</code> and key.
        <blockquote><span class='mark'>Note:</span> In JavaScript, <code>this</code> keyword when used with the object's method refers to the object. <code>this</code> is bound to an object.
        </blockquote>
        However, the function inside of an object can access it's variable in a similar way as a normal function would. For example,
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/02/06.js' eval js-tutor></pre>

    </ul>

                <li>In the above example, <code>function Person()</code> is an object constructor function.

                    To create an object from a constructor function, we use the <code>new</code> keyword.

                    Hence basically, the JavaScript method is an object property that has a function value.</li>
                <blockquote><span class='mark'>Note:</span> It is considered a good practice to capitalize the first letter of your constructor function.
                </blockquote>

    <h4>JavaScript this Keyword</h4>
    In JavaScript, when <code>this</code> keyword is used in a constructor function, <code>this</code> refers to the object when the object is created. For example,
    <ul>
    <!--Every code you want to present, you will copy it from the site and paste it in js file with anumber and just change the number here-->
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/03/03.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        Hence, when an object accesses the properties, it can directly access the property as <code>person1.name</code>.
    </ul>
</article>

<article class="code-article hline ">
    <!--Here the sub-subtitle in the section between h4-->
    <h4>JavaScript Constructor Function Parameters</h4>
    You can also create a constructor function with parameters. For example,
    <ul>
    <!--Every code you want to present, you will copy it from the site and paste it in js file with anumber and just change the number here-->
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/03/04.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        In the above example, we have passed arguments to the constructor function during the creation of the object.
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/03/05.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        This allows each object to have different properties. As shown above,

        <code>console.log(person1.name)</code>; gives <code>John</code>

        <code>console.log(person2.name)</code>; gives <code>Sam</code>
    </ul>

<article class="code-article hline ">
    <!--Here the sub-subtitle in the section between h4-->
    <h4>Create Objects: Constructor Function Vs Object Literal</h4>
        <li>Object Literal is generally used to create a single object. The constructor function is useful if you want to create multiple objects. For example,</li>
    <ul>
    <!--Every code you want to present, you will copy it from the site and paste it in js file with anumber and just change the number here-->
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/03/06.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/03/07.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        <li>Each object created from the constructor function is unique. You can have the same properties as the constructor function or add a new property to one particular object. For example,</li>
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/03/08.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        Now this age property is unique to <code>person1</code> object and is not available to <code>person2</code> object.

        However, if an object is created with an object literal, and if a variable is defined with that object value, any changes in variable value will change the original object. For example,
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/03/09.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        When an object is created with an object literal, any object variable derived from that object will act as a clone of the original object. Hence, any change you make in one object will also reflect in the other object.
    </ul>

    <h4>Adding Properties And Methods in an Object</h4>
    You can add properties or methods in an object like this:
    <ul>
    <!--Every code you want to present, you will copy it from the site and paste it in js file with anumber and just change the number here-->
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/03/10.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        In the above example, a new property <code>gender</code> and a new method <code>greet()</code> is added to the <code>person1</code> object.

        However, this new property and method is only added to <code>object1</code>. You cannot access <code>gender</code> or <code>greet()</code> from <code>object2</code>. Hence the program gives error when we try to access <code>person2.greet()</code>;
    </ul>

    <!--Every code you want to present, you will copy it from the site and paste it in js file with anumber and just change the number here-->
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/03/12.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        In JavaScript, strings can be created as an object by:
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/03/13.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        In JavaScript, numbers can be created as an object by:
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/03/14.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        In JavaScript, booleans can be created as an object by:
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/03/15.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        <blockquote><span class='mark'>Note:</span> It is recommended to use primitive data types and create them in a normal way, such as <code>const name = 'John';</code>, <code>const number = 57;</code> and <code>const count = true;</code>

            You should not declare strings, numbers, and boolean values as objects because they slow down the program.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote><span class='mark'>Note:</span> In JavaScript, the keyword <code>class</code> was introduced in ES6 (ES2015) that also allows us to create objects. Classes are similar to constructor functions in JavaScript.
        </blockquote>
    </ul>

                Before you learn prototypes, be sure to check these tutorials:
            </p>
            <ul>Here is an example of a JavaScript object.
                <li>JavaScript Objects</li>
                <li>JavaScript Constructor Function</li>
                As you know, you can create an object in JavaScript using an object constructor function. For example,
                <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/04/01.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
                In the above example,<code>function Person()</code> is an object constructor function. We have created two objects <code>person1</code> and <code>person2</code> from it.
            </ul>

    <h4>JavaScript Prototype</h4>
    In JavaScript, every function and object has a property named prototype by default. For example,
    <ul>
    <!--Every code you want to present, you will copy it from the site and paste it in js file with anumber and just change the number here-->
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/04/02.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        In the above example, we are trying to access the prototype property of a <code>Person</code> constructor function.

        Since the prototype property has no value at the moment, it shows an empty object <code>{ ... }</code>.
    </ul>

    <!--Here the sub-subtitle in the section between h4-->
    <h4>Prototype Inheritance</h4>
    In JavaScript, a prototype can be used to add properties and methods to a constructor function. And objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype. For example,
    <ul>
    <!--Every code you want to present, you will copy it from the site and paste it in js file with anumber and just change the number here-->
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/04/03.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        In the above program, we have added a new property <code>gender</code> to the <code>Person</code> constructor function using:
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/04/04.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        Then object <code>person1</code> and <code>person2</code> inherits the property <code>gender</code> from the prototype property of <code>Person</code> constructor function.
        Hence, both objects <code>person1</code> and <code>person2</code> can access the <code>gender</code> property.
        <blockquote><span class='mark'>Note:</span> The syntax to add the property to an object constructor function is:
            <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/04/05.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        </blockquote>
        Prototype is used to provide additional property to all the objects created from a constructor function.
    </ul>

    <h4>Add Methods to a Constructor Function Using Prototype</h4>
    You can also add new methods to a constructor function using prototype. For example,
    <ul>
    <!--Every code you want to present, you will copy it from the site and paste it in js file with anumber and just change the number here-->
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/04/06.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        In the above program, a new method <code>greet</code> is added to the <code>Person</code> constructor function using a prototype.
    </ul>

<article class="code-article hline ">
    <!--Here the sub-subtitle in the section between h4-->
    <h4>Changing Prototype</h4>
    If a prototype value is changed, then all the new objects will have the changed property value. All the previously created objects will have the previous value. For example,
    <ul>
    <!--Every code you want to present, you will copy it from the site and paste it in js file with anumber and just change the number here-->
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/04/07.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        In the above program, a new method <code>greet</code> is added to the <code>Person</code> constructor function using a prototype.
        <blockquote><span class='mark'>Note:</span> You should not modify the prototypes of standard JavaScript built-in objects like strings, arrays, etc. It is considered a bad practice.
        </blockquote>
    </ul>

    <h4>JavaScript Prototype Chaining</h4>
    If an object tries to access the same property that is in the constructor function and the prototype object, the object takes the property from the constructor function. For example,
    <ul>
    <!--Every code you want to present, you will copy it from the site and paste it in js file with anumber and just change the number here-->
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/04/08.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        In the above program, a property <code>name</code> is declared in the constructor function and also in the prototype property of the constructor function.

        When the program executes, <code>person1.name</code> looks in the constructor function to see if there is a property named <code>name</code>. Since the constructor function has the name property with value <code>'John'</code>, the object takes value from that property.

        When the program executes, <code>person1.age</code> looks in the constructor function to see if there is a property named <code>age</code>. Since the constructor function doesn't have <code>age</code> property, the program looks into the prototype object of the constructor function and the object inherits property from the prototype object(if available).


        <blockquote><span class='mark'>Note:</span> You can also access the prototype property of a constructor function from an object.
        </blockquote>
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/04/09.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        In the above example, a <code>person</code> object is used to access the prototype property using <code>__proto__</code>. However, <code>__proto__</code> has been deprecated and you should avoid using that.
    </ul>

                In JavaScript, there are two kinds of object properties:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Data properties</li>
                <li>Accessor properties</li>

    <h4>Data Property</h4>
    Here's an example of data property that we have been using in the previous tutorials.
    <ul>
    <!--Every code you want to present, you will copy it from the site and paste it in js file with anumber and just change the number here-->

    <h4>Accessor Property</h4>
    In JavaScript, accessor properties are methods that get or set the value of an object. For that, we use these two keywords:
    <ul>
        <li><code>get</code> - to define a getter method to get the property value</li>
        <li><code>set</code> - to define a setter method to set the property value</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>JavaScript Getter</h4>
    In JavaScript, getter methods are used to access the properties of an object. For example,
    <ul>
    <!--Every code you want to present, you will copy it from the site and paste it in js file with anumber and just change the number here-->
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/05/02.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        In the above program, a getter method <code>getName()</code> is created to access the property of an object.
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/05/03.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        <blockquote><span class='mark'>Note:</span> To create a getter method, the <code>get</code> keyword is used.
        </blockquote>
        And also when accessing the value, we access the value as a property.
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/05/04.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        When you try to access the value as a method, an error occurs.
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/05/05.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
    </ul>

    <h4>JavaScript Setter</h4>
    In JavaScript, setter methods are used to change the values of an object. For example,
    <ul>
    <!--Every code you want to present, you will copy it from the site and paste it in js file with anumber and just change the number here-->
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/05/06.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        In the above example, the setter method is used to change the value of an object.
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/05/07.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        <blockquote><span class='mark'>Note:</span> To create a setter method, the <code>set</code> keyword is used.
        </blockquote>
        As shown in the above program, the value of <code>firstName</code> is <code>Monica</code>.

        Then the value is changed to <code>Sarah</code>.
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/05/08.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        <blockquote><span class='mark'>Note:</span> Setter must have exactly one formal parameter.

    <!--Here the sub-subtitle in the section between h4-->
    <h4>JavaScript Object.defineProperty()</h4>
    In JavaScript, you can also use Object.defineProperty() method to add getters and setters. For example,
    <ul>
    <!--Every code you want to present, you will copy it from the site and paste it in js file with anumber and just change the number here-->
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/05/09.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        In the above example, <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> is used to access and change the property of an object.

        The syntax for using <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> is:
        <pre class='line-numbers' data-src='./js/snippets/04.objects/05/10.js' eval js-tutor></pre>
        The <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> method takes three arguments.
    <li>1. The first argument is the objectName.</li>
    <li>2. The second argument is the name of the property.</li>
    <li>3. The third argument is an object that describes the property.</li>
    </ul>
